## Orks
1. Ghazghkull Thraka: Prophet of the Waaagh! by Nate Crowley
"Very good book, (Minor note author hamfistedly shows his politics twice, didn't take away from the story but was done in a very jarring aside and then in a quick in world debate) 

## Fabius Bile
  Primogenitor by Guy Haley
  Genefather by Guy Haley

## Dark Imperium

## Belisarus Cawl
Belisarius Cawl: The Great Work by Guy Haley

## Blood Angels
Dante by Guy Haley
"Not Era Indomitus per say but one of the best modern 40k books." 



The Devastation of Baal by Guy Haley also (Space Marine Conquests Book 1)
"Date calls out to all the sons of Sanguinius to make a stand against the Tyriands on their genesire's homeworld. More of this books is prep and then some will be comfortable with. The actual engagment is profound lore wise but it doesn't stand and raise to the standard you would expect. There's alot of battles in 40k and this one wasn't written very well. The ending isn't great either but there's lots of lore the final few chapters"


Darkness in the Blood by Guy Haley "Lots of lore and overall plot development, primarus surgery etc, the curse, very meta book"


Astorath Angel of Mercy by Guy Haley
"The opening act is slow and middling but the second act is fantastic. This novella shines with brilliant side characters, intresting enemies and a great setting.
