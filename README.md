## Log

## Inprogress
# Spear of the Emperor by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
# Harrowmaster (Renegades) by Mike Brooks







# Knights of Macragge by Nick Kyme
Ultra Marines ?? company are stuck in the warp for years, their ship is boarded muliple times and the crew goes insane. 
They finally break out of the warp and find themselves still with a ship that's out of power and crash land on a primative human world. 
The humans are being killed out by the "bone swine" tldr orks and then necrons. Ultra Marines win and the world was actually a colony that was under the influence of a cronomancer.

**Review**
Lost in the warp is hard to do well, landing on the planet was good as it had a very old 40k feel untill the necrons show up and kinda kill the vibe. 
**3.5/5**

# Indomitus by Gav Thorpe

Ultra Marines ?? company, is part of the cursed part of the indomitus crusade, they engage a Chaos ship, board it but the situation is a trap and soon find themselves facing down a grand battle ship, they barley escape.
some time latter they're called to report back to the crusade and instead the captain answers a warning call, they get stuck in the warp after running into the pairah nexus.
They fight the Necrons win but lose and as they die they get a messanger out to G-man to warn him about the Necron Nexus. 

**Review**
Starts pretty bad, the null zone is cool, the necrons are goofballs and im not sure if I can stand another story where they're written like this. 
**2/5**


# War of Secrets by Phill Kelly
The Dark Angels are sent to hunt some Tau, but actually the Tau and the Dark Angels are hunting a Chaos traitor Dark Angel who's infecting the Tau's ally humans.
The oil planet, the other space marine chapters planet. Primarus vs OG, Cop out cowards ending, 

**Review**
Starts rough is pretty good by the end lore wise. 

**3.5/5**

## Orks
1. Ghazghkull Thraka: Prophet of the Waaagh! by Nate Crowley
"Very good book, (Minor note author hamfistedly shows his politics twice, didn't take away from the story but was done in a very jarring aside and then in a quick in world debate) 







  Genefather by Guy Haley

## Dark Imperium
Dark Imperium by Guy Haley (#1 in series) (Two versions, the original and a timeline retcon) 



## Belisarus Cawl
Belisarius Cawl: The Great Work by Guy Haley

## Blood Angels
Dante by Guy Haley
"Not Era Indomitus per say but one of the best modern 40k books." 



The Devastation of Baal by Guy Haley also (Space Marine Conquests Book 1)
"Date calls out to all the sons of Sanguinius to make a stand against the Tyriands on their genesire's homeworld. More of this books is prep and then some will be comfortable with. The actual engagment is profound lore wise but it doesn't stand and raise to the standard you would expect. There's alot of battles in 40k and this one wasn't written very well. The ending isn't great either but there's lots of lore the final few chapters"


Darkness in the Blood by Guy Haley "Lots of lore and overall plot development, primarus surgery etc, the curse, very meta book"


Astorath Angel of Mercy by Guy Haley
"The opening act is slow and middling but the second act is fantastic. This novella shines with brilliant side characters, intresting enemies and a great setting.
