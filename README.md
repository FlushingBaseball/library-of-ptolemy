Im going to stop punishing myself with the past, and I will live in the present

# Thesis
Gamesworkshop has awful websites, they don't make you want to buy anything, they don't inspire you to join the hobby, they don't do a good job of entering you into the setting...
I can do better and I enjoy 40k so I'm going to build a better black library.

1. This isn't a wikipedia this is will be a beautiful display site where people will want to spend time. 

## Features
1. Overall animated paralax setting timeline (defaults from death of the emperor onwards)
2. 

Taking a backseat but high resolution models is going to be key.


Step one books
step two models
Step Three History

Use the same library for the spring mechanics. 

Flip card. 

Make it an app for google play



Explantatory site for the editions and rules

## historical price data? 


Onboarding process to start a new series.

##### The Emperor's Gift by Aaron Demski-Bowden narrated by Christopher Kent
Follow a particularly talented Grey Knight through one of the chapters darkest periods
##### Review
One of the worst 40k books I've ran into so far. The first 40% of the book is bad dialogue, bad action scenes and poor character development. 
The last sixty percent is a good concept executed poorly. Two famous chapters facing off, the first war for Armageddon and a final battle should in theory
be captivating set pieces that might make it worth reading but instead it's done in a shockingly bland and uninspired manner. 
**Performance**
This is my first experience with Christopher Kents narration so hopefully it's catching him on the worst performance of his career.
I understand the POV from which he is narrating is a character who lacks depth of emotion and comments on this, however there's barley any 
effort put into the various grey knights and the inquisatorial agents, he does fine with the space wolves but thats not much of a challenge. 
**1.8/5**


#### Assassinorum Kingmaker by Robert Rath (Narrated by Gareth Armstrong)
A critical mission requires the best operatives the assassinorm temple can provide. 
A Knight planet looks like it has gone rouge so a team is dispatched to do what is necessary
##### Review
Fantastic, this is the book that proves 40k is a great setting even without the Astartes when done right. 
**Performance**
Gareth Armstrong gave an amazing reading of this book, he dedicated himself to finding the characters and breathed life into the text
**4.5/5**



#### Lord of Excess (Renegades) by Rich McCormick (Narrated by Richard Reed)
A Chaos Warband of Emperor's Children end up coming into possesion of a rich Imperial World who hasn't seen contact with the empire in 30+ years. 
How can a bunch of of dopamine addicted Slannesh worshipers rule a planet? Find out. 
##### Review
Watching Chaos Marines destroying genestealers was a fantastic way to start the book, it's a shame the book didn't manage to keep itself coherent. 
The author has alot of ideas which are good but then rushes to cram them all into a certain amount of pages and just fumbles the book in it's entirety.
Important very fun things happen off screen and boring brick laying scenes from POV's you're not bought into happen on screen to push the story along. 
If this book was 100 more pages or broken into two it could of had a proper slennishy debauched attempt of reordering a society, the seeds of disquiet 
against the adored being sown, the breakdown of the warband etc. They could of showed and not told. 
**Performance**
Richard Reed had a single good voice namely the gov, but on the whole it was a middling performance. 
**3/5**



#### Lazarus Enmity's Edge by Gary Kloster (Narrated by John Banks)
The battered 4th company under comander Lazarus is sent to a respond to a beacon 
Lazarus rightly questions the sanity of the search for the fallen when it means many dark angels die when 
the chapter master steals his air support 

##### Review
Not very good, the Dark Angels in general are and odd sort and in this book come across as incredibly dumb.
The best character by far is learned Temu (Seriously temu lmao) a mortal "werid book"?
Fungas Maguffin is so bad the characters in the book take time multiple times to say wait how does this guy
keep doing stuff we think is impossible and they just shrug their shoulders and say idk our enemy is OP? 

**Performance**
Banks does quite a few 40k books, his performance is always done well but seemingly lacks the range of voices/inflections to make the listening experience go down as smooth as it could. Overall he still remains a fine performer
**2.9/5**

##### Ashes of Prospero by Gav Thorpe (Space Marine Conquests Book 2) (Narrated by John Banks)
The Space Wolves are stretched thin, still recovering from Magnuses invasion of Fenris the rune lord accidently looks towards prospero and gets possessed by the spirt of a thousand suns sorcerer who claims
that the only way he can be banished is if they travel to Prospero and free him from Magnus's maze which also has the 14th company in it111!!!
##### Review
Not a space wolf fan but this was really good, the action took a back seat to the characters (and there wasn't much of it)
but the thousand sons character was great idk I liked it alot (4/5) but the start is overly descriptive of the scenery. 
**3.9/5**




##### The Gate of Bones by Andy Clark (Dawn of Fire Book 2)
The Indomitus Crusade's opening movement continues as a key shrine world has been taken by Word Bearers. 

##### Review
Anytime there's a wider arch in which a 40k book takes place in the work feels more substantive. 
The Word Bearers are done justice and it's not just a evil for evil's sake depiction of chaos which is always great. 
The Knights content is bad and not done well, but the Custodies and Guard content is slightly above average. 

**2.8/5**



##### The Lords Of Silence by Chris Wraight (Narrated by John Banks)
A Death Guard warband deals with the internal politics of their legion (Answer Abadons call? Typus vs Mortarian etc) and the events surrounding the universe immediately after the opening of the great rift. 

## Review
Good, the Death Guard are well written horrors, you can't hate them enough but you can't help but be astonished at life within the twisted legion of Nurgle. 
Good lore, the space battle is well written but the ground battle is poor. 
**3/5**







##### Harrowmaster (Renegades) by Mike Brooks (Narrated by Theo Solomon)
The Alpha Legion the masters of plots and subterfuge are caught off guard by something they didn't plan for (The Imperium mildly reforming)
Who's tricking who? Who's just three layers of irony deep when there's actually four? 
The Alpha Legion starts being drawn togeather as seperate warbands bow to the Harrowmasters.
## Review
Alpha Legion style chaos is a nice breather from the typical heretics, the trouble is the book isn't very good. 
The overall strokes of a shattered legion starting to come around to the idea that they need to centralize 
is great, the inquisitor(s) stuff is awful, the combat after the opening scene is awful. If you weanted Alpha Legion lore
you got it, if you wanted a good book...

Theo Solomon was an intresting choice, for the narration. 
**2/5**


##### Spear of the Emperor by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
A lone Mentor and his three battle thralls cross the rift to record the fate of a region of space and to meet with it's space Marines. The region and the space marines have all suffered without any contact from the rest of the Imperium. Traitors and Chaos space marines. 

## Review
Very good, the thrall POV was different, kinda refreshing, good lore, mid to bad book. 
Two thirds of the book is mid to bad but the last third is quite, quite good. 
It's a very hard book to rank, but the ending seems to make some of the slog worth it.
I find myself wondering why the whole book couldn't have been written to that level. 
**3.7/5**



##### Knights of Macragge by Nick Kyme
Ultra Marines ?? company are stuck in the warp for years, their ship is boarded muliple times and the crew goes insane. 
They finally break out of the warp and find themselves still with a ship that's out of power and crash land on a primative human world. 
The humans are being killed out by the "bone swine" tldr orks and then necrons. Ultra Marines win and the world was actually a colony that was under the influence of a cronomancer.

**Review**
Lost in the warp is hard to do well, landing on the planet was good as it had a very old 40k feel untill the necrons show up and kinda kill the vibe. 
**3.5/5**

##### Indomitus by Gav Thorpe

Ultra Marines ?? company, is part of the cursed part of the indomitus crusade, they engage a Chaos ship, board it but the situation is a trap and soon find themselves facing down a grand battle ship, they barley escape.
some time latter they're called to report back to the crusade and instead the captain answers a warning call, they get stuck in the warp after running into the pairah nexus.
They fight the Necrons win but lose and as they die they get a messanger out to G-man to warn him about the Necron Nexus. 

**Review**
Starts pretty bad, the null zone is cool, the necrons are goofballs and im not sure if I can stand another story where they're written like this. 
**2/5**


##### War of Secrets (Space Marine Conquests Book 3) by Phill Kelly
The Dark Angels are sent to hunt some Tau, but actually the Tau and the Dark Angels are hunting a Chaos traitor Dark Angel who's infecting the Tau's ally humans.
The oil planet, the other space marine chapters planet. Primarus vs OG, Cop out cowards ending, 

**Review**
Starts rough is pretty good by the end lore wise. 

**3.3/5**

##### Ghazghkull Thraka: Prophet of the Waaagh! by Nate Crowley
A captured Gretchen tells the unlikley story of how Ghazghull rose to the greatest ork of the 41st Millenium 

**Review**
"Very good book, (Minor note author hamfistedly shows his politics twice, didn't take away from the story but was done in a very jarring aside and then once more in a quick in world debate) 
**4.5/5**

##### Avenging Son by Guy Haley (Dawn of Fire Book 1)

**Review**
Terra is an intresting place and it's minor and side characters are always nice. 
Historians etc

**3/5**



##### Astorath Angel of Mercy by Guy Haley
The head chaplin of the Blood Angels arrives to help the remnants of a primaris succesor chapter deal with the aftermath of the black rage. Xenos, the warp, oh my. 

**Review**
The opening act is slow and middling but the second act is fantastic. This novella shines with brilliant side characters, intresting enemies and a great setting.
Feels like old warhammer which is what I personally enjoy. 
**3.7/5**






##### The Lion:  Of The Forest by Mike Brooks
A second primarch just kinda shows up, where's he been? Ahhhhh? 
The Lion has a dude where's my legion hangover and remembers he kinda lost it last night (10,000) years ago. 
He walks though a warp metaphor, runs into some old friends and starts putting his life back togeather. 

**Review**
Not good, what should be a crazy and pivotal moment for the setting was brought to the fans with a very below average showing. 
It feels like there should be a second book where the actual intresting stuff happens but that never came so the Lion is back but
if you read this book you just wouldn't care very much. 
**1.5/5**

##### Watchers of the Throne by Chris Wraight (The Emperor's Legion #1)  (Narrated by Gareth Armstrong)
A defacto high lord of Terra, a Custodian and a sister of silence walk into a bar.
**2.5/5**



##### The Regent’s Shadow by Chris Wraight (The Emperor's Legion #2)



#### The Carrion Throne by Chris Wraight (Vaults of Terra #1) Narrated by John Banks
An Inquistor is assigned a new protege, they hunt after something that turns out to be a dark eldar who someone brought to terra itself!
This series was decent? 
#### The Hollow Mountain by Chris Wraight (Vaults of Terra #2)
###### Summary

#### The Dark City by Chris Wraight (Vaults of Terra #3)
###### Summary


##### Primogenitor by Joshua Reynolds (Fabius Bile #1) Narrated by John Banks
Meet Fabius Bile the apothacry of Fulgrims Legions who's still alive doing evil stuff. 
He raids a Eldar Craftworld for soul stones etc.

**Review**
The entire plot about how the harlequins play in is ???
The supporting cast is pretty good
**3/5**

"Date calls out to all the s of Sanguinius to make a stand against the Tyriands on their genesire's homeworld. More of this books is prep and then some will be comfortable with. The actual engagment is profound lore wise but it doesn't stand and raise to the standard you would expect. There's alot of battles in 40k and this one wasn't written very well. The ending isn't great either but there's lots of lore the final few chapters"


##### Darkness in the Blood by Guy Haley
"Lots of lore and overall plot development, primarus surgery etc, the curse, very meta book"
